abstract: "Neural retrieval models (NRMs) have been shown to outperform
their statistical counterparts owing to their ability to capture semantic meaning via dense document representations. These models,
however, suffer from poor interpretability as they do not rely on
explicit term matching. As a form of local per-query explanations,
we introduce the notion of equivalent queries that are generated by
maximizing the similarity between the NRMâ€™s results and the result
set of a sparse retrieval system with the equivalent query. We then
compare this approach with existing methods such as RM3-based
query expansion and contrast differences in retrieval effectiveness
and in the terms generated by each approach."
