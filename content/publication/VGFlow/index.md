abstract: "The task of human reposing involves generating a realistic image of a person standing in an arbitrary conceivable pose. There are multiple difficulties in generating perceptually accurate images, and existing methods suffer from limitations in preserving texture, maintaining pattern coherence, respecting cloth boundaries, handling occlusions, manipulating skin generation, etc. These difficulties are further exacerbated by the fact that the possible space of pose orientation for humans is large and variable, the nature of clothing items is highly non-rigid, and the diversity in body shape differs largely among the population. To alleviate these difficulties and synthesize perceptually accurate images, we propose VGFlow. Our model uses a visibility-guided flow module to disentangle the flow into visible and invisible parts of the target for simultaneous texture preservation and style manipulation. Furthermore, to tackle distinct body shapes and avoid network artifacts, we also incorporate a self-supervised patch-wise 'realness' loss to improve the output. VGFlow achieves state-of-the-art results as observed qualitatively and quantitatively on different image quality metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, FID). Results can be downloaded from Project Webpage."
