abstract: "Large language models are widely used, but aligning them with societal values remains challenging. Current approaches often rely on human annotations, which are hard to scale, or synthetic data produced by models that may themselves be misaligned, making it difficult to capture genuine public opinion. This limits scalability and introduces demographic biases that reduce the representativeness and fairness of model behavior. We introduce a novel approach to pluralistic alignment through behavioral learning, grounded in the psychological principle that actions (behavior) have strong consistency with opinions. Specifically, we present ALPHA50M, a dataset of over 50 million samples derived from 1.5 million real-world advertisements, incorporating rich behavioral signals inferred from demographic engagement patterns. Models trained on this data achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on diverse alignment benchmarks spanning cultural reasoning, political views, and social values. We also propose two new benchmarks: OpinionQA-XL, which covers surveys across 100+ societal topics, and GSS, which evaluates temporal opinion shift modeling over decades. Our results demonstrate that learning from behavioral signals, derived from observed human actions, enables models to align with diverse demographic opinions, capture underlying social and cultural norms, and generalize to new topics and surveys beyond training data. This behavioral learning paradigm offers a scalable and demographically broad alternative to existing alignment techniques. Our datasets and code are available at https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/align-via-actions."
