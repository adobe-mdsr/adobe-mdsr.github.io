abstract: "Transformer models across multiple domains such as natural language processing and speech form an unavoidable part of the tech stack of practitioners and researchers alike. Au-dio transformers that exploit representational learning to train on unlabeled speech have recently been used for tasks from speaker verification to discourse-coherence with much success. However, little is known about what these models learn and represent in the high-dimensional latent space. In this paper, we interpret two such recent state-of-the-art models, wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay, on linguistic and acoustic features. We probe each of their layers to understand what it is learning and at the same time, we draw a distinction between the two models. By comparing their performance across a wide variety of settings including native, non-native, read and spontaneous speeches, we also show how much these models are able to learn transferable features. Our results show that the models are capable of significantly capturing a wide range of characteristics such as audio, fluency, supraseg-mental pronunciation, and even syntactic and semantic text-based characteristics. For each category of characteristics, we identify a learning pattern for each framework and conclude which model and which layer of that model is better for a specific category of feature to choose for feature extraction for downstream tasks."
