My areas of interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence include Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Multi-Modal applications, knowledge graph-based reasoning, question answering, and dialogue systems. I have worked in co-inventing deep learning-based document and form structure extraction models as part of Adobe AEM Forms that are currently being used in Automated Form Conversion Service. I have also invented a topic model-based text content recommendation workflow that provides a personalized text feed on Adobe Communities. Have authored various patents and academic publications which have been accepted at top-tier research conferences such as ECCV, ACL, WACV, EMNLP, NAACL etc., some of which are currently used in production in Adobe products as described above. My aim is to identify impactful research areas to develop solutions that can be used in practical applications.
