I am Yaman Kumar Singla, a research scientist and lead in the Adobe Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) laboratory, where I study large language and vision models (LLMs, VLMs) in the context of advertising, marketing, and behavior modality. The behavior modality consists of the following components: (1) Speaker, (2) Content, (3) Channel, (4) Receiver, (5) Behavior (Effect). One can also include other components in these five: (6) Time of sending and (7) Time of receiving.

Therefore, from this point of view, I try to solve the following questions:
- Behavior Simulation: How will a certain audience behave for a certain message sent by a certain sender at a sender time over a certain channel?
- Personalization or Customer Behavior Optimization with Content as a Hook: How should a message be constructed such that it gets a certain behavior from a certain audience?
- Targeting or Audience Optimization: To whom should a message be sent in order to get a certain effect?
- Speaker Optimization: Who should send a message to get a certain effect? (for example, choose the appropriate influencer account)
- Time Optimization: What time and with what frequency should a message be sent so that it gets a certain effect?
- Transsuasion: How to convert lower-engaging content to higher-engaging content for a certain audience and speaker (advertiser/marketer)?
- Ultimately, how much free will is there with humans when making decisions?


My research is about designing large language and human behavior models that can predict human behavior, generate content that can bring about needed behavior, and explain behavior. This involves explaining, predicting, and optimizing human behavior in the real world, especially from the context of marketing, advertising, and computational social science.

A list of works related to behavior in the wild by me and my team can be found here: https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io. The motivation as to why I work on the behavior modality and why behavior in the wild should be solved at all is covered in this [blog](https://sites.google.com/view/yaman-kumar/blog/from-peas-to-people-why-we-need-to-solve-the-human-behavior-puzzle?authuser=0).

I have been awarded [multiple awards and honors](https://sites.google.com/view/yaman-kumar/awards) from industry and academia for my contributions.
