I work as a research scientist on Adobe Digital Experience Platform products to characterize, preserve, and enhance the narrativity of consumer experiences.

I graduated from my PhD program in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, under the supervision of Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan in the [Signal Analysis & Interpretation Lab](https://sail.usc.edu).
My PhD disseration built a computational pipeline to identify, resolve, describe and represent narrative characters in textual and visual stories.
As part of this, I have worked on coreference resolution, information extraction, attribution, opinion mining, and long context modeling.

I have worked with government ([US Chamber Foundation](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org)), non-profit ([Geena Davis Institute](https://geenadavisinstitute.org)), and industry (Google) partners on computational social science projects to measure representation biases in media content.
I completed my Master and Bachelors degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

I am interested in story-telling! Understanding the different agents and their interactions, reasoning about their actions, analyzing their impact on the audience, recommending novel progressions of the plot to creators -- to try and answer the question -- *how we can tell better stories to the consumer?*
