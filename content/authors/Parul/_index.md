Hello! I am Parul, a Machine Learning Research Scientist at the Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) Lab, Adobe.

I am currently in the final stages of PhD at Monash University under the supervision of Dr. Thanh-Toan Do, Prof. Abhinav Dhall and Dr. Munawar Hayat, where I have been working in the domain of Computer Vision, specifically focusing on the Applications of Diffusion Models in limited supervision based scenarios. Particularly, I have explored Image Generation in personalized, few-shot and long-tailed settings.

Previously, I have also worked in the domain of Deepfake Detection as a part of my Bachelor's thesis at IIT Ropar. Besides these, I have also been studying the functioning of Large Multimodal models and accessible AI tools through Neuro-symbolic methods.

Feel free to reach out to me via the links under my profile picture.
