Hello! I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at the Media and Data Science Research Lab. My primary research interests are in the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, semantic web and knowledge graphs. I am also affiliated with [IIIT-Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) as an Adjunct Faculty.

I am always on the lookout for students interested in working on research problems. Please have a look at my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8HVTWNkAAAAJ&hl=en) page and feel free to get in touch with me in case the interests align.

Previously, I worked as a Research Staff Member in IBM's India Research Laboratory at New Delhi, India. Prior to that, I was a member of the Watson group at IBM Almaden Research Centre where I led the analytic efforts in the Watson Knowledge Graph team. I did my post-doctoral research at Xerox Research Centre Webster in upstate NY. Before that I obtained my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University.
