I am Neeraj, a Research Associate at the Media and Data Science Research Lab at Adobe. I hold an integrated Master of Technology in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad.

Previously, I have worked on neural network efficiency techniques such as quantization and binarization, the use of large language models in the particle physics domain, and hallucinations in large language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs). Currently, my research interests include multimodal learning, real-world applications of LLMs, and reinforcement learning. If you are interested in these areas or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me.
