I find anything that is challenging enough interesting. Among the top of my interests would be artificial intelligence and computational physics.

I am working on productizing various vision applications that are being developed by our lab in the vision domain. We are currently working to introduce co-pilot experiences in a range of adobe products spanning both experience and creative cloud. Checkout some of our work in the publications list and feel free to reach out if you think our products/research areas are something that is of interest to you.
