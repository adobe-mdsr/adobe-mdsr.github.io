I am Varun, a research associate at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research lab. My research pursuits encompass Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Graph Learning and Cognitive AI. I have worked on harnessing the power of human behavior to enhance content intelligence. I successfully applied this pioneering concept by leveraging the cognitive signals contained in artificially generated human gaze patterns to improve both image and natural language understanding tasks. 

My current focus is on developing diverse capabilities in multimodal LLMs to empower a gamut of applications. 

I hold a B.Tech (with Honors) degree in Computer Science & Engineering and a Minor in Economics from IIIT-Delhi.
