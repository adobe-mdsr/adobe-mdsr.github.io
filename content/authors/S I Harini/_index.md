I’m Harini, a Research Associate at Adobe Media and Data Science Research. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from BITS Pilani.

My research focuses on building agents that can reason, plan, and learn over time by drawing on how humans make sense of the world through inference, abstraction, and accumulated experience. I am especially interested in grounding these capabilities in complex, real-world settings and making them more robust.

In the past, I’ve worked on using large language models to understand and model different aspects of human behavior, including memorability, persuasiveness. Through this, I’ve explored how language models can reflect underlying human preferences, and how this understanding can be used to build more adaptive systems.
