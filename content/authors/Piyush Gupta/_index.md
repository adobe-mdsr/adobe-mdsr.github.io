I am a Principal Machine Learning Research Scientist at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab. My expertise lies in developing innovative solutions at the intersection of machine learning, data analysis, and user personalization.

My primary areas of research focus on Interpretable Machine Learning, Topological Data Analysis and Insights discovery, and recommendation techniques leveraging contextual Multi-armed Bandit and Reinforcement Learning to drive personalized user experiences. Additionally, I investigate optimization strategies for Large Language Model training and architecture, as well as explore the emerging opportunities and applications of Generative AI, including Agentic workflows.
