I am involved in the field of Human-Computer Interaction Research, where her primary focus is on narrowing the divide between humans and technology through the creative development and innovation of technology and interactions that cater to human needs and enhance experiences. My background covers a range of areas, including Human AI Interaction, ICTD (Information Communications Technology for Development), and Interaction Design and Development. I deploy mixed method research and build interactive systems to build equitable and empowering user experiences. I completed my bachelor's degree in technology in Computer Science and Design from Indraprastha Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India.
