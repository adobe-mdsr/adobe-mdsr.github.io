I am Somesh, a research associate at Adobe and a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University at Buffalo and IIIT Delhi, advised by Prof. David Doermann and Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah respectively. My work explores Large Language and Vision Models, reasoning, and planning through external and internal agents. My PhD is generously funded by Adobe.

My research interests lie at the intersection of human behavior and machine learning. With billions of individuals shaping our world, each life leaves a unique trajectory influenced and defined by "decisions" and randomness ultimately shaping our preferences or "behavior" towards things, people, or even ourselves. A list of works related to behavior in the wild by me and my team can be found at Behavior in the Wild.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from BITS Pilani.
