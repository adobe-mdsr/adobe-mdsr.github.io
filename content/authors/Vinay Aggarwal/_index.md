Hello, I am Vinay, a Deep Learning Research Scientist at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) Lab.

Previously, I worked at Google where I was involved in understanding and annotating Multimodal content. I led the development & productionization of an image annotation system for Google Lens improving the CTR of the Related Search Tile. I also worked on improving the document understanding stack of Google, directly impacting the Search Results.

Before that, I worked as a Research Associate at Adobe Bangalore where my work spanned extracting semantic and design information from banners, improving understanding of form like documents and AI-assisted drafting of contracts. 

At the MDSR Lab, my research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and sociology, where I am working on leveraging LLMs to get insights about human behavior and to predict their responses in certain scenarios.

Feel free to reach out to me via the links under my profile picture.
