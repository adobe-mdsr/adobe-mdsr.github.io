I am a Research Associate at Adobe, in the Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) lab, where I mostly work on various facets of language models (LMs) e.g., in the past, I worked on data-efficient pre-training of LMs, instruction tuning, prompt sensitivity etc. Recently, I've also been looking into interpretability of LMs.

Prior to joining Adobe, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) in 2023, with a Bachelors degree (with Honors) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My long-term research goal is to develop provably beneficial intelligent computational *agents* that can excel at both formal linguistic competence (the knowledge of rules and statistical regularities of language) and functional linguistic competence (the ability to use language in real-world situations).

If you share an interest in these topics and would like to exchange research ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me via [e-mail](hrenduchinta@adobe.com).
