I am a Research Scientist at Adobe within the Media and Data Science Research Lab, where I contribute to the research and development of deep learning algorithms for various products. 

My research focuses on geometric and topological machine learning, applying techniques like persistent homology to analyze structured and sequential data. I also work on reinforcement and in-context learning, particularly in the context of model alignment, interpretability, and scalability.
