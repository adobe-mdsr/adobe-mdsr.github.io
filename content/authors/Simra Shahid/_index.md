I am a Research Scientist at the Media and Data Science Research Lab. My work focuses on improving and appling language technologies to improve how information is presented and made accessible to users for better decision making. I have incorporated several language modeling services within Adobe products, including document recommendation (Adobe DX Marketo, Adobe CC Community), topic model based post routing to experts (Adobe CC Community), and question-answering conversational systems (Adobe DX Marketo, Adobe DX-AEP AI Assistant). Currently, I am interested in exploring the intersection of humanâ€“AI collaboration and multi-agent systems.
 
Among other achievements, I have mentored around twelve interns guiding some of them through their first experiences writing patents and publications. I'm passionate about mentoring and making STEM more inclusive of perspectives and ideas from different backgrounds. I've guided K-12 students, undergraduates, and professionals about AI and how to use it effectively in their work through talks and initiatives.
