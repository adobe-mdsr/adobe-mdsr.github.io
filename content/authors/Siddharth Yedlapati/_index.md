I am Siddharth Yedlapati, a Research Associate at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab. 

My research is driven by the goal of creating systems that operate as a natural extension of human cognition by mirroring human patterns of reasoning, judgment, and decision making. At Adobe, I apply this principle by developing LLM based architectures and autonomous agents that are not only capable of addressing complex, real world challenges but are also fundamentally aligned with human perception, judgment, and workflows.

I am also interested in exploring how LLMs can be leveraged to model emergent behaviors and latent human preferences, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes that drive human behavior.

If you find these topics engaging and would like to exchange research ideas, feel free to reach out to me via the links under my profile picture.
