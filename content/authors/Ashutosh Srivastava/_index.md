I am Ashutosh Srivastava, a Research Associate at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee.

My interest lies at the intersection of generative AI, computer vision, and multimodal learning. I’m particularly interested in diffusion models, multimodal systems, autonomous agents, and 3D computational geometry — and how these technologies can augment human creativity to solve complex, real-world challenges.

If you find these topics engaging and would like to exchange research ideas, feel free to reach out to me via the links under my profile picture.
