I am Sarthak Mehrotra, a Research Associate at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab.

I have previously worked on research problems such as domain generalization, federated learning, object repositioning, and visual question answering. Currently, my interests lie in developing multimodal models and constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks.        

<!-- Previously, I have worked on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval research problems in healthcare applications such as Patient Trial Matching and Clinical Data Abstraction leveraging large language models to streamline oncology research and care.

Currently, I am working at the intersection of Multimodal Machine Learning and Behavioural Sciences with a direct impact on digital marketing and advertising. -->
