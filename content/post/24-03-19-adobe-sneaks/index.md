The MDSR team partnered with the Adobe Experience Manager Sites team to deliver Project SiteLeap, an innovative AI solution that revolutionizes website content management and redesign processes.

For brands, changing content management systems or redesigning a site can mean costly and extended disruptions to the everyday work of marketers â€” ultimately impacting the customer experience across their digital channels. Project Site Leap can simplify the process. It uses an AI agent that analyzes images, then connects with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to update content automatically. In seconds, the agent can analyze existing brand webpages, import content into AEM and even restyle pages to align with new design mocks. This ensures that if a brand has to change their technology systems or look and feel, teams have uninterrupted access to the channels that drive customer engagement.
