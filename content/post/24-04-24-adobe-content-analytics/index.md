The MDSR team partnered with Adobe Analytics and Intelligent Services team to deliver Content Analytics, a comprehensive solution that empowers creative and marketing teams to make data-driven optimizations through detailed content performance insights, customer engagement metrics, and conversion measurement.

## Content Insights and Asset Conversion

Content Analytics provides key asset metrics such as impressions, click-through rates, top-performing attributes, and placements to help understand how published images engage visitors. Teams can view asset performance and engagement rates alongside conversion metrics to determine which images and assets are driving results, while also evaluating how entire webpage experiences contribute to conversion with additional filtered views.

## Content Intelligence

The platform enables teams to quickly investigate large volumes of content data with intuitive, out-of-the-box reporting and visualization tools. Features include:

- **Advanced analysis**: Filter data by asset, attribute, metadata, audience, engagement and more
- **Content performance templates**: Purpose-built templates that generate performance metrics and visualizations
- **Asset inspector**: View asset thumbnails within the interface with detailed metadata insights
- **Anomaly detection**: In-app alerts for statistically significant anomalies in content data
- **Audience publishing**: Define and share audiences based on content engagement across Adobe products

## Data Connection and AI-Driven Automation

Content Analytics unlocks a new level of insights with AI and ML services that automatically extract and organize image attributes for analysis:

- **Automatic image attribution**: AI-powered assignment of relevant attributes like color, background tone, emotion, aesthetic, and keywords
- **Data connections**: Link content event data with customer behavioral data to uncover impact on engagement and conversion
- **Simplified tagging structure**: Reduce complexity using a single Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK
- **Automatic asset identification**: AI service that assigns asset IDs to unique images without duplication (in development)

Cross-channel performance capabilities that help understand how paid media and email assets lead to conversions are currently in development.
