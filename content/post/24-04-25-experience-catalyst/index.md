Experience Catalyst is an AI-driven assistant that automates onboarding to AEM Edge Delivery Services. It aims to migrate existing websites, whether they come from another CMS, older AEM implementations, or even from visual designs alone, into modern Edge Delivery projects. Quality Assurance of the migrated webpages is of major importance to all customers and manually checking 1000+ webpages for regressions in content, style and layout is very expensive and time consuming. The MDSR team has delivered two large scale quality assurance tools -  A style critic and a content critic which enable automated quality assurance checks across a large dataset of migrated webpages. 

## Style Critic Agent

The Style Critic Agent is a novel system that performs a granular, multi-modal comparison of webpages. Our agent recursively decomposes a page into its constituent elements, intelligently matches corresponding components using a combination of visual and textual embeddings, and performs a bottom-up, context-aware analysis to identify differences ranging from subtle style deviations to significant layout shifts. The agent provides a comprehensive difference report and an overall style similarity score, which are then leveraged by a Styling Agent to refine and restyle migrated webpages to ensure visual fidelity and style consistency at scale.

## Content Critic Tool

The Content Critic Tool automatically detects textual differences between original and migrated webpages across large datasets â€” analyzing over 10,000+ page pairs in just seconds. It generates detailed reports with content similarity scores and text diffs, enabling the Experience Catalyst team to quickly pinpoint and resolve pages with low-quality migrations, ensuring content consistency at scale.
