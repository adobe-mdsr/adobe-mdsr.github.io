The MDSR team partnered with Adobe Marketo Engage to deliver the GenAI-powered Interactive Webinars feature, transforming how marketers create, deliver, and measure webinar content.

## AI-Generated Video Chapters: Enhanced Navigation and Engagement

The new AI-generated video chapters automatically organize webinar recordings into easily navigable sections, enabling viewers to quickly find relevant information and jump directly to topics of interest. This intelligent organization reduces search time, increases user satisfaction, and drives higher engagement with webinar content, delivering better outcomes for both marketers and attendees.

## Customizable AI-Generated Content

Marketers maintain full control with the ability to fine-tune AI-generated summaries and chapters. Customization options include adjusting chapter length, merging or splitting sections, and tailoring content to align with brand messaging. This flexibility creates a more focused and engaging experience while ensuring marketers can shape the final output to meet their specific needs.

These innovative GenAI features, now globally available, are designed to improve marketer efficiency while enhancing the overall webinar experience for audiences.
